### Code Review

At ProctorU, any change to the `master` branch will, at minimum, go through two code reviews from an Engineer. If the changes made affect the front-end, a member of our Design team will perform the third review. Below are a few guidelines to follow during the review process.

##### Everyone

- Avoid selective ownership of code. ("mine", "not mine", "yours")
- Always ask for clarification if you are unsure about something.
- Keep it real and fun. Use emojies, gifs, etc. :+1:
- Give back your time to code review, like others do for you.

##### Having Your Code Reviewed

- Use the Pull Request template in your favor.
- Add the corresponding JIRA ticket to each Pull Request.
- Add detailed reproduction/user-flow steps that are easy to follow.
- Add "potentially impacted"/"vulnerable areas" in additional to reproduction steps.
- Be grateful and appreciative to the code reviewer.
- Help to clear any misconceptions the reviewer may have.
- Wait until your code has the `ready to merge` label before merging.

##### Reviewing Code

- Understand the change. Understand _why_ the change is being made.
- Identify areas for refactoring that still solve the problem.
- Add the appropriate label after you have reviewed and approved (`reviewed`, `ready to merge`, or `design approved`).
