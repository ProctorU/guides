## Best Practices

A simple guide for coding in style.

##### Emails

- Use Mandrill to send emails in `production`.
- Use Mandrill Templates as the email markup.
- Intercept emails on pre-production servers with [Letter Opener Web](https://github.com/ProctorU/letter_opener_web).

##### URLs

- Prefer dashes over underscores in paths. [Reference](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/76329?hl=en).

##### Files

- Files should have a trailing whitespace at the end of the file.  Set your text editor to do this for you automatically.
