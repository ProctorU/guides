### Ruby

In additional to the following guidelines, please also use the [.rubocop.yml](./.rubocop.yml) configuration file for new projects in conjunction with [HoundCI](https://houndci.com).

##### General
- Prefer `&&` and `||` over `and` and `or`.
- Prefer `map` over `collect`.

##### Testing
- Prefer `assert_not` over `refute`.
